WHAT ARE SERVLETS?
Servlets are the building blocks of almost every java web application.
They provide the core functionality to accept HTTP requests and return
HTTP responses to the user. Even if you use JSP to build your web pages,
the JSP files are eventually compiled to Servlets by the application server
or web container such as Glassfish or Tomcat. Servlets are essential for your
web container to do it’s job, serving GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS and
TRACE requests and return a response to web clients. You are most probably
familiar with GET and POST requests. I strongly recommend to invest some time
and read about the other types of request listed above. If you don’t know them
yet, go and read this paper now
